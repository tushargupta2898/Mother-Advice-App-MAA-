Mother Advice App(MAA) - Smart india Hackathon project

Introduction

Maternal mortality Rate(MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. 
The duration for which government does the monitoring is from the date of registration to 42 days after delivery.
50-98% of maternal deaths are caused by direct obstetric causes (hemorrhage, infection, and hypertensive disorders, ruptured uterus, hepatitis, and anemia). 
MMR in India has not declined significantly in the past 15 years. 

Introduction of the project

The problem statement is targeted for development of website / app to create awareness amongst women to improve maternal healthcare.
We tried to do that by collecting maternal data through user friendly and highly accessible multilingual mobile app. 
This first hand information is verified and supplemented by Anganwadi and regional ANM staff. 
The concerned ministry also needs a portal for other bodies in the hierarchy like the National Reproductive and Child Healthcare Programme ( RCH ). 
The maternal data across the country has to be aggregated for analysis and identification of primary factors responsible for High Risk Pregnancies , at early stages of pregnancy and we have done 
Also a block chain based supply chain tracking system is desired for tracking the government supplies for maternal healthcare.

Issues & Solutions

Mother's don’t have any interfacing to interact with any government employee.
with our app mothers can contact to ANM, anganwadi workers and doctors in their region.
Mother's are not aware of the policies and facilities they are eligible.
a single point platform for availing all the schemes and policies they are eligible for as well as getting aware by daily tips and video tutorials.
Mothers are not getting benefits at proper time:
Here in our solution data gets centralized so everyone involved will be able to speed up the process and mothers will get necessary support soon.
Work load on ANM and anganwandi workers is too much.
Work load will be reduced due to centralized database which will reduce  redundancy  also there won't be any need to conduct multiple surveys for the same programs as database won't be destroyed.
ANM needs to do double work by filling the form online as well as register.
because of centralized database, ANM can upload the information via app or web, and no need to do the same job of entries again and again.
ANM have pressure to register pregnant women before 3 months to get benefits:
ANM and anganwadi workers field work make their task tedious and there is no way that pregnant women can register themselves. With our app we are reducing ANM and anganwadi workers task a bit by providing a platform for pregnant mothers to register their presence.   
Government is not able to track the facilities provided by them.
the higher authorities or supervisors can inspect on the supply as whoever is receiving the supply is marking it as received and cant modify the figures due to block-chain mechanism.
Government is not able to analyze the reasons for maternal mortality rate specifically.
policy makers or ministry will be able to analyze the factors responsible for MMR via bar graph and heat map, and able to modify old or make new policies accordingly.
